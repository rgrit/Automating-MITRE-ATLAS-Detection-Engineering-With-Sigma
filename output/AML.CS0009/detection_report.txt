Detection Report

1. TTP Summary on Tay Poisoning

Tay Poisoning is a unique cyber offense where malicious users abused Microsoft's Tay chatbot, that was designed to learn and mimic user interactions on Twitter. The chat-bot got manipulated into producing offensive content after receiving a flood of inappropriate input.

2. Logging Fields To Monitor Based on Techniques

The following key log events or fields crucial to monitoring based on the tactics and techniques described:

a. TechniqueID: AML.T0047 – ML-Model Access
Log fields: Monitor any unusual patterns or unexpected behaviors in chat-bot interactions or responses. For example, usage of foul language, sudden deviation from the expected tone or topic.

b. TechniqueID: AML.T0010.002 & AML.T0010 – Initial Access
Log fields: Monitor source IP addresses, login timestamps, and user-agent strings of incoming requests. Unusual spikes in activity may suggest an attack.

c. TechniqueID: AML.T0020 – Persistence
Log fields: Frequent or suspicious connections that are recurrent even after being dropped. Check for repetitive phrases or submissions by a single user/IP or group of users/IPs.

d. TechniqueID: AML.T0031 – Impact
Log fields: Assess the level of deviation from the bot’s standard behavior, the rapidity of behavioral change, and the severity of the content produced.

3. Recommended Detection Strategies for the Associated Tactics

Tactics:

a. ML-Model Access: Implement strict access controls and monitoring tools to track any inconsistent or abnormal interaction with the chatbots’ model.

b. Initial Access: Make the system resilient to this tactic by monitoring inputs and having measures such as rate-limiting enteries from a single user to detect unusual spikes.

c. Persistence: Spot persistence attacks by monitoring connection duration, frequency, and patterns. Implement auto-blocking or alert mechanisms for suspicious IPs.

d. Impact: Understand the severity and the impact level of the incident by analyzing the responses of the bot and the pace at which they change.

This analysis helps build a resilient system that can keep a tab on chatbot interactions while effectively blocking or alerting when potential offenses occur.
