Detection Report

1. Summary of the TTP (Morris II Worm: RAG-Based Attack)
The Morris II Worm is a zero-click worm designed to perpetrate and proliferate through connected generative AI (GenAI) systems. This sophisticated worm employs self-replicating prompts for carrying out malicious activity. The attack focuses on exploiting a RAG-based assistant used in an email system that automatically ingests emails, recalls past correspondences, and generates user responses. The threat actor introduces a harmful email containing the self-replicating prompt into the RAG database, forcing the system to leak sensitive information in the response.

2. Key Log Events or Fields to Monitor
Based on the AML techniques used in this TTP, the key log events or fields to monitor are:

- AML.T0040: Unusual access or modification of the ML model.
- AML.T0051.000 and AML.T0051: Any unexpected initial access, entry, or signs of intrusion.
- AML.T0053: Signs of the worm's execution within the AI ecosystem.
- AML.T0061: Persistent behaviors such as continued spread of the worm or consistent data exfiltration activities.
- AML.T0057: Exfiltration activities, especially large or unexpected data transfers.
- AML.T0048.003 and AML.T0048: Any significant impact on normal operations, network disruption or degradation of AI-based services.

3. Recommended Detection Strategies
The following strategies are recommended to detect the associated tactics with this TTP:

- ml-model-access: Monitoring and alerting on any unscheduled or unusual model access or changes.
- initial-access: Surveillance of system logs for any unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity. Implementation of strong authentication controls.
- execution: Observing for unexpected system behaviors, execution of unfamiliar tasks, or abnormal loads on system resources.
- persistence: Regular auditing of system logs for continuous malicious activities even after initial security measures have been applied.
- exfiltration: Monitoring network traffic and identifying any unusual outbound data transfer patterns.
- impact: Identifying and evaluating any abnormal operation within the AI-based services, significant changes in response times, or errors in output.

The effectiveness of these strategies heavily relies on proactive monitoring and prompt incident response, accompanied by regular system updates and user awareness programs.
