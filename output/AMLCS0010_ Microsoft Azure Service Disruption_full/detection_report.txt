Without information on the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), it's difficult to generate a detailed detection report. Typically, these reports include the nature of the threat as detailed in the TTP, recommended steps for monitoring and detection, and mitigation strategies. 

Please provide more information on the specific TTP under consideration to provide a more accurate and helpful report.
