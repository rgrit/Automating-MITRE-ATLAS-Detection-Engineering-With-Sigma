Based on the information provided, there are no specific details on the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). However, by following the standard procedure, here is a general guide on what such a detection report should cover:

1. **Summary of the TTP**  
As there is no specific Threat, Tactic, and Procedure (TTP) provided, it's challenging to outline a definite assessment. Generally, a summary would detail the observed or potential malicious activities tied to a specific threat actor or identified malware family, giving an overview of the tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with it.

2. **Key log events or fields to monitor based on the techniques**   
Without concrete details on specific TTPs, we are unable to provide the exact log events or fields to monitor. However, commonly monitored logs include system logs (Windows Event logs, Syslogs), application logs (Web Server logs, Database logs), network logs (Firewall logs, IDS/IPS logs, Netflow data) and user activity logs. Unusual activities like login failures, privilege escalation, changes in configurations, export of data, unfamiliar IP addresses or domains contacted, can be a signal of a security incident.

3. **Recommended detection strategies for the associated tactics**   
In light of the missing information, standard detection strategies would propose a layered security approach combining various defensive strategies. These include using Intrusion Detection Systems/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), establishing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, conducting regular audits, and behavioral based analysis for threat hunting. 

In addition, it's critical to have timely patch management, enforce least privilege, and configure systems securely to minimize the attack surface. Moreover, training staff to recognize phishing attempts, maintaining relevant cyber threat intelligence, having a robust backup and disaster recovery plan, and regular penetration testing can all play a big part in improving an organization’s security posture. 

To obtain a more specific and in-depth report and recommendations, detailed information on the TTPs is necessary. This would typically include description of the threat, potential vulnerabilities exploited, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), and the resulting impact. If such details could be provided, a more thorough analysis and specific remediation strategy could be formulated.
