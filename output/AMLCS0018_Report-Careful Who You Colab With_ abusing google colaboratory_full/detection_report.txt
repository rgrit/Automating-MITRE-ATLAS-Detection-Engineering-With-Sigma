Given the lack of specific TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) details, it is a bit challenging to provide a comprehensive detection report. However, an overall general approach toward creating a cybersecurity prevention plan can be proffered in the absence of specifics.

1. Summary of TTP:

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) are representative conceptualizations used in cybersecurity to understand the behavior or modus operandi of cyber threat actors. They are fundamental to any risk analysis as they help in understanding threat vectors, actor motivations, and mitigating strategies.

A hypothetical TTP may involve a multitude of individual actions, for instance, initial compromise through spear-phishing, lateral movement using credential harvesting, and eventual exfiltration of data through command and control servers. The specific TTP under investigation is unknown in this case, hence a more generalized approach towards detection, prevention, and mitigation is recommended.

2. Key log events or fields to monitor:

A crucial step in the detection of any TTP is identifying and monitoring key log events. Given the lack of specifics, these might include:

   - Login failures and successes (especially from strange locations)
   - Unusual or unexpected network traffic trends
   - Unexpected system or service configurations changes
   - Changes in file permissions or creation of new, unexpected files and directories.
   
3. Recommended detection strategies for the associated tactics:

Given the lack of specifics, these strategies should be broad and general to take care of a wide range of possible tactics:

   - Anomaly detection systems: Unusual patterns of behavior on the network or a host computer can often signal an intrusion. A sudden increase in data transfers or strange login times could be clues.
   
   - Threat intelligence feeds: Continuous update and integration of information from threat intelligence feeds can help keep your defenses informed about the latest tactics being used by threat actors.
   
   - Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): These monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and alert administrators when such activities are discovered. An IDS/IPS can be crucial in early threat detection.
   
   - Regular audits: Regular system and network audits to assess vulnerabilities can be an effective tactic to preemptively discover potential points of compromise.

Wrap-up: Without specifics, it is challenging to tailor detailed actionable strategies against any possible TTP. However, maintaining a robust overall defense posture which includes anomaly detection, threat intelligence feeds, IDS/IPS, and regular audits can go a long way towards ensuring the security of an organization's infrastructure. Additionally, effective employee education and training on cybersecurity hygiene can prevent various phishing, and social engineering-based tactics that could be the first step of a threat actor's TTP.
