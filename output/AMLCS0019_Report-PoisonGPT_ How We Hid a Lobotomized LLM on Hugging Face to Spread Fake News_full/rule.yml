Sorry, but it's impossible to create a Sigma rule based on the provided detection
  report because there are no details about TTP (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures)
  or any other specific characteristics about the threat. Sigma rules are based on
  the specific patterns of a threat to facilitate its detection. Without these, a
  Sigma rule cannot be written. It would be like trying to describe someone without
  having any information about them. We need specifics like which system was attacked,
  which logs were affected, what suspicious activity was noticed etc, to create a
  detection rule.
