As no specific TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) details have been provided, it's impossible to give an analysis on a particular cybersecurity threat or give customized recommendations. However, I can provide some general tips on TTP detection strategies and potential log events to monitor.

1. Summary:
The term TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures used in cybersecurity to refer to the patterns of activities or methods associated with specific threat actors or groups. They describe how threat actors operate to achieve their objectives, from the initial access to an environment (tactic) to the specific way they might execute a command (technique) to a series of actions they may take (procedure).

2. Key Log Events or Fields to Monitor:
In general, and without specifics, active monitoring of these different fields can help detect compromises:
   - Unauthorized logins or multiple failed login attempts
   - Unusual network traffic patterns or large amounts of data transfer
   - File access and modifications especially on critical assets
   - Changes to firewall and network configurations
   - New software or services installation
   - System or application crashes
   - Unusual scheduled tasks

3. Recommended Detection Strategies:
The following strategies are relevant when considering general detection practices:
   - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): A SIEM solution can collect and aggregate log data generated throughout the organization's technology infrastructure, to identify and report on cybersecurity threats and anomalous behavior.
   - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): EDR tools are fundamental in detecting and investigate suspicious activities on endpoints.
   - User Behavior Analytics (UBA): UBA uses machine learning algorithms to detect abnormalities in the behavior of users, which might signal a possible compromise.
   - Regular Auditing: Regular and comprehensive security audits are key to identify potential weaknesses and breaches in security.
   - Threat Intelligence: Use of updated threat intelligence feeds can provide information about known bad indicators such as IP addresses, domains, etc. 

Unfortunately, without more specific details about the TTP in question, a more detailed analysis cannot be provided.
