As there are no TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) details or tactics listed, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive cybersecurity detection report. However, without a concrete TTP and tactic description, we can outline general guidelines for monitoring, detection, and defense strategies.

1. Summary of TTP: Since no specific TTP is provided, we must be prepared on all fronts and consider all potential attack vectors. A TTP refers to the behavior and methods typical to a specific kind of threat agent or attack. Without knowledge of specifics, general cyber hygiene practices should be implemented such as suspicion of abnormal behavior, early warning alert systems, and prioritizing security software updates.

2. Key log events or fields to monitor: Without a specific technique or procedure to inform the focus of data collection, typical areas to focus on could include:

    - Unauthorized access attempts or log-in failures.
    - Changes in file or system configurations.
    - Changes or spikes in network traffic.
    - Privilege escalation attempts.
    - Abnormal behavior such as new or unexpected processes, unusual data transfers, or sudden changes in storage use.

3. Recommended detection strategies: Without listed tactics to determine specific defenses, general detection strategies would include:

    - Regularly updating and patching all systems and software to protect against known vulnerabilities.
    - Deploying intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities.
    - Implementing stringent access control measures and applying the principle of least privilege.
    - Regularly performing security audits and assessments to discover potential weak points.
    - Implementing end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.
    - Regular staff training to recognize phishing attempts and other common attack vectors.
    - Employing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate and analyze log data from various sources in real-time.
  
In summary, even without specific TTP details or tactics, a robust and comprehensive security posture involves a holistic approach. Cybersecurity is about understanding the threat landscape, risk management, and continuous evaluation and improvement. We recommend a detailed threat assessment be conducted to identify the exact TTP and associated tactics.
