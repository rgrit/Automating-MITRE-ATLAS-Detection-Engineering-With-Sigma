Without any provided details about the TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), log events, techniques, or tactics, it is impossible to produce an insightful analysis or propose detection strategies. 

TTPs are critical in cybersecurity as they map out the behavior of a cyber threat, such as an attacker or malware. Understanding the specific TTP can help an organization prepare their defenses in a manner that specifically targets the threat’s pattern of attack.

Log events or fields to monitor would typically include the areas of your system that the TTP interacts with. This could include email systems, user login data, or network traffic, depending on the TTP.

Detection strategies often involve identifying these interactions between the TTP and your systems. This could involve anomaly detection in your network traffic, heuristic analysis for known TTP patterns in your logs, or artificial intelligence that can identify TTPs in real time.

Please provide specific TTP details for a more specific analysis.
