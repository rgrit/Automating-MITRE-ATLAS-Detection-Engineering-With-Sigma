Due to the lack of specific TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) details, a comprehensive detection report cannot be made accurately. However, here's a general approach to tackling such cyber threats:

1. **Summary of Unknown TTP:** An unknown TTP implies unidentified techniques, tactics, and procedures cyber threat actors could be using to exploit vulnerabilities. The lack of a detailed description presents a significant challenge, as the specifics surrounding the attack vector, threat actor behavior, and tactics involved are unknown. This makes detection, prevention, and mitigation considerably tricky.

2. **Key Log Events or Fields to Monitor:** In this scenario, due to the unknown nature of the TTP, it's advisable to focus on general indicators of compromise that can often be found in logs:
   * Unusual Outbound Network Traffic
   * Anomalies in Privileged User Account Activity
   * Geographical Irregularities
   * Increases in the Volume of Data being Transferred
   * Multiple Failed Login Attempts
   * Unexpected Patching of Systems
   * Unusual System Reboots or Shutdowns
   * Changes in System Files and System Permissions 
   * Discovery of Unknown or Unapproved Software on Systems

3. **Recommended Detection Strategies:**
    
   * **Regular System Audit:** A regular audit of the system is crucial to detect any unusual changes in the file system, access privileges or system configurations.
  
   * **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring of all systems, network traffic and user behaviors to flag any abnormal activities. AI/ML-based systems can significantly improve the detection of anomalous behaviors.
   
   * **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Use EDR solutions to provide real-time monitoring and detection of system events in endpoints, allowing immediate response to mitigate the threat.
   
   * **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Leverage IDS to monitor networks for malicious activity or policy violations that are often indicative of a cyber threat.
   
   * **Monitor System Vulnerabilities:** Regular monitoring of the system vulnerabilities will allow for the proactive patching of known vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation by threat actors.
   
   * **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):** A UBA system can identify abnormal behavior or deviations from baseline patterns that may indicate a potential threat.

Please provide specific TTP details and other pieces of information, such as involved IP addresses, domain names, hash values, etc., for a more precise analysis and resultant actions.
